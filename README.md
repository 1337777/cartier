AnthropLOGIC.com WorkSchool 365 for e-commerce and e-learning with applications to proof-assistants for geometric algorithmics and quantum physics

The MODOS proof-assistant is the homotopical computational logic for geometric dataobjects and parsing, which is some common generalization of the constructive-inductive datatypes in logic and the sheaves in geometry.
