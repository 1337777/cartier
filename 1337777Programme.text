SHORT ::

  1337777.OOO SOLUTION PROGRAMME [[https://gitlab.com/1337777]] originates from some random-moment dia-para-computalogical discovering-engineering-and-teaching of some convergence of the DOSEN PROGRAMME [[http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/~kosta]] along the COQ PROGRAMME [[https://coq.inria.fr]] .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//maclaneSolution.svg]] [[1337777.OOO//coherence2.v]] [[1337777.OOO//maclaneSolution2.thy]] [[google.com/#q=1337777.OOO/coherence2.v]] [[https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/coq-club/2016-01/msg00090.html]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160627011042/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1337777/dosen/master/coherence2.v]] that the attempt to deduce associative coherence by Maclane is not the reality , because this famous pentagon is in fact some recursive square (reflective-functorial associativity-elimination cut-elimination resolution) . This associative coherence is the meta-terminology for the completeness-lemma of the (oriented-)semiassociative coherence [[1337777.OOO//coherence.v]] and this semiassociative coherence does lack some more-common Newman-style local confluence lemma .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//borceuxSolution2.v]] [[1337777.OOO//chic05.pdf]] that the "categories" ( "enriched categories" ) only-named by the homologist Maclane are in reality interdependent-cyclic with the natural polymorphism of the logic of Gentzen , this enables some programming of congruent resolution by cut-elimination [[1337777.OOO//dosenSolution3.v]] which will serve as specification (reflection) technique to semi-decide the questions of coherence (sameness-of-morphisms) , in comparison from the ssreflect-style .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//ocic03-what-is-normal.djvu]] [[1337777.OOO//laoziSolution2.v]] how to program the grammatical polymorph coparametrism functors ( "comonad" ) .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//chuSolution.v]] how to program the grammatical contextual singleton-or-multiple-or-total limits of polymorph functors ( "Kan extension" ) .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution.v]] how to program the metafunctors-grammar ( "presheaves" , "colimit completion" ) , and did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution2.v]] how to program the grammatical pairing-commutant retractive reflection ( "localization" , "calculus of fractions" , "special factorization system" , "universal closure operator" , "Galois-topology" ) , and did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution3.v]] the lacking new elimination-scheme for expressing the dependence of limit-objects over grammatical morphisms via their sense-decoding ( "Yoneda" ) as metatransformations functions ; this technique is used to program grammatical polymorph metafunctors-full-subcategory containing-equalizers generated by some views ( "completion" ) ... These earlier attempts are the primo step towards the programming of the ( "classifying-topos" ) sheaf-metafunctors-grammar which is held as augmented-syntax in the Diaconescu duality lemma ( "coreflective-metafunctors models" ) , and confirm the presence of some MODOS grammar , which is some style of "substructural topos" where the dependence of limit objects upon morphisms need not be grammatical ( "Yoneda" ) ! ... and where oneself could present grammatical polymorph views-data ( "sheaves" ) , grammatical polymorph generating-views ( "presentable category" ) , grammatical polymorph internal functors ( "internal category" ) , grammatical polymorph images ( "regular category" ) , grammatical polymorph unions ( "coherent category" ) ...

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution4.v]] how to program grammatical polymorph internal ( "typed" , "small" ) pairing-projections ( "product" ) ... And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution5.v]] how to program grammatical polymorph contextual ( "weighted" ) multifold ( "enriched" ) pairing-projections ( "product" ) ...

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution6.v]] how to program grammatical polymorph non-contextual ( "1-weighted" ) 2-fold ( "2-higher" ) pairing-projections ( "product" ) ... ( this multi-folding is the foundation of homotopy "algebraic topology"/"fibre functor" ) ...

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution7.v]] how to program grammatical polymorph generated-functor-along-reindexing ( "Kan extension" ) ...

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//cartierSolution8.v]] how to program grammatical polymorph « modos » / modified-colimits-into-viewed-functors ( "sheafification" , "forcing" ) ... « MODOS » (modified-colimitS) is the alpha-omega of polymorph mathematics . It shows the interdependence of computational-logic along geometry : sensible "soundness" lemma , cut-elimination , confluence lemma , sense-completeness lemma ( in presheaves whose combinatorics mimick "links"/"proof-net" ) , maximality lemma , asymptotics of randomness , DOSEN book ... ; generated-functors ( "Diaconescu lemma" ) , equalizer completion ,  image ( "regular" ) completion , essential geometric-morphisms ( "Cauchy completion" ) , BORCEUX book 1-2-3 ...

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//dosenSolution101.v]] how to program the logical/particular/rewriting/(one-step) polymorphism/cut-elimination and the confluence/commutation of this rewriting for the grammatical polymorph pairing-projections ( "product" ) , which shows that this logical resolution ( by non-linear arithmetic grade ) is indeed some alternative description of the computational/total/asymptotic/reduction/(multi-step) polymorphism/cut-elimination chosen-function ( by linear arithmetic grade ) .

  And 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//aignerSolution.v]] [[1337777.OOO//ocic04-where-is-combinatorics.pdf]] that the Galois-action for the counting-modulo ( "symmetry groupoid action" ) , is in fact some instance of reversible polymorph metafunctors . Another further step shall be resolve whether these are also some instance of localization of metafunctors-grammar . Yet another further step shall be to GAP-and-COQ program [[https://www.gap-system.org]] the computational logic for Tarski's decidability in free groups and for asymptotic/convergence of infinite random groups ...

  Necessarily , 1337777.OOO did discover-engineer-and-teach [[1337777.OOO//1337777solution.txt]] random-moment dia-para-computalogic , « noisea » forced-fool-and-theft/lie/falsification ( "absence of reality" ) .
